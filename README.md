Automated API Testing with REST Assured

Overview

This project demonstrates automated API testing using Java and REST Assured. It covers the full life cycle of a resource by performing the following operations on a product:

1. Validating API Responses

        API responses consist of three key components:
        
        Status Code – Verifies the request result (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found)
        
        Headers – Contains metadata (cookies, connection details, etc.)
        
        Body – Holds the actual data returned from the API

2. HTTP Methods Used

        POST – Create a new product
        
        PUT – Update the existing product
        
        GET – Retrieve product details
        
        DELETE – Remove the product

3. Response Validation Techniques

        Status Code Verification – Ensures correct HTTP response status
        
        Response Body Verification – Checks for expected fields and values
        
        Header Validation – Confirms metadata consistency

4. Complex Response Handling – Validates arrays, nested objects, and data structures

5. Running the Tests
